# kalman-filter
Control the TurtleBot 3 robot with your keyboard in Gazebo and visualize its trajectory in RViz filtered by a Kalman filter 

You will need ROS-Kinetic, Gazebo and the Rviz plugins installed for the code to run.
This repository is the src folder of the catkin workspace, and is referred to as "src" hereafter. 
Assuming that you have ROS-Kinetic installed appropriately, run the following commands:
```
Navigate to the folder containing src
$ mkdir catkin_ws
$ mv src catkin_ws/src
$ catkin_make
```
